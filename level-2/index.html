        This specification defines an API for sharing text, links and other
        content to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice.

        The available share targets are not specified here; they are provided

        Usage Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        This example shows a basic share operation. In response to a button
        click, this JavaScript code shares the current page's URL.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Basic usage">
        shareButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
          try {
            await navigator.share({ title: "Example Page", url: "" });
            console.log("Share successful");
          } catch (err) {
            console.error("Share failed:", err.message);
          }
        });
      </pre>
      <p data-link-for="ShareData">
        Note that a <a>url</a> of <code>''</code> refers to the current page
        URL, just as it would in a link. Any other absolute or relative URL can
        also be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to this call to <a>navigator.share()</a>, the user agent
        would display a picker or chooser dialog, allowing the user to select a
        target to share this title and the page URL to.

        Share targets
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn data-lt="share targets">share target</dfn> is the abstract
        concept of a destination that the user agent will transmit the share
        data to. What constitutes a share target is at the discretion of the
        user agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A share target might not be directly able to accept a <a>ShareData</a>
        (due to not having been written with this API in mind). However, it
        MUST have the ability to receive data that matches some or all of the
        concepts exposed in <a>ShareData</a>. To <dfn>convert data to a format
        suitable for ingestion into the target</dfn>, the user agent SHOULD map
        the fields of <a>ShareData</a> onto equivalent concepts in the target.
        It MAY discard fields if necessary. The meaning of each field of the
        payload is at the discretion of the share target.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each share target MAY be made conditionally available depending on the
        <a>ShareData</a> payload delivered to the <a>share()</a> method.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Once a share target has been given the payload, the share is considered
        successful. If the target considers the data unacceptable or an error
        occurs, it can either recover gracefully, or show an error message to
        the end-user; it cannot rely on the sender to handle errors. In other
        words, the <a>share()</a> method is "fire and forget"; it does not wait
        for the target to approve or reject the payload.
      </div>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Examples of share targets
        </h3>
        <p>
          The list of share targets can be populated from a variety of sources,
          depending on the user agent and host operating system. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built-in service (e.g., "copy to clipboard").
          </li>
          <li>Native applications written for the host operating system.
          </li>
          <li>Contacts (e.g., the user agent directly shares to a person from
          the user's address book, using a specific app).
          </li>
          <li>Websites (e.g., the user agent fills in a template URL with the
          fields of the <a>ShareData</a>, then navigates to that URL in a new
          browsing context).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          There is an attempt to standardize the registration of websites to
          receive share data for that final use case; see <a href=
          "https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target">Web Share Target</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          In some cases, the host operating system will provide a sharing or
          intent system similar to Web Share. In these cases, the user agent
          can simply forward the share data to the operating system and not
          talk directly to native applications.
        </p>
        <p data-link-for="ShareData">
          Mapping the <a>ShareData</a> to the share target (or operating
          system)'s native format can be tricky as some platforms will not have
          an equivalent set of fields. For example, if the target has a "text"
          field but not a "URL" field, one solution is to concatenate both the
          <a>text</a> and <a>url</a> fields of <a>ShareData</a> and pass the
          result in the "text" field of the target.

        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Web Share enables data to be sent from websites to native applications.
        While this ability is not unique to Web Share, it does come with a
        number of potential security issues that can vary in severity
        (depending on the underlying platform).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a requirement to not allow the website to learn which apps
        are installed, or which app was chosen from <a>navigator.share()</a>,
        because this information could be used for fingerprinting, as well as
        leaking details about the user's device.
        </li>
        <li>Implementors will want to carefully consider what information is
        revealed in the error message when <a>navigator.share()</a> is
        rejected. Even distinguishing between the case where no targets are
        available and user cancellation could reveal information about which
        apps are installed on the user's device.
        </li>
        <li>There is a requirement that <a>navigator.share()</a> presents the
        user with a dialog asking them to select a target application (even if
        there is only one possible target). This surface serves as a security
        confirmation, ensuring that websites cannot silently send data to
        native applications.
        </li>
        <li>Due to the capabilities of the API surface,
        <a>navigator.share()</a> is <a data-cite=
        "WEBIDL#dfn-available-only-in-secure-contexts">available only in secure
        contexts</a> (such as <code>https://</code> schemes).
        </li>
        <li>Use of <a>navigator.share()</a> from a <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode">private browsing mode</a>
        might leak private data to a third-party application that does not
        respect the user's privacy setting. User agents could present
        additional warnings or disable the feature entirely when in a private
        browsing mode, but this is not mandated as the chooser UI could be
        considered sufficient warning.

        <li>The data passed to <a>navigator.share()</a> might be used to
        exploit buffer overflow or other remote code execution vulnerabilities
        in native applications that receive shares. There is no general way to
        guard against this, but implementors will want to be aware that it is a
        possibility.

      <h2>
        Extensibility of this API
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Web Share API is designed to be extended in the future by way of
        new members added to the <a>ShareData</a> dictionary, to allow both
        sharing of new types of data (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=
        "https://github.com/WICG/web-share/issues/12">images</a>) and strings
        with new semantics (<i>e.g.</i> author).
      </p>
      <div class="warning">
        This doesn't mean user agents can add whatever members they like. It
        means that new members can be added to the standard in the future.
      </div>
      <p data-link-for="ShareData">
        The three members <a>title</a>, <a>text</a>, and <a>url</a>, are part
        of the base feature set, and implementations that provide
        <a>navigator.share()</a> need to accept all three. Any new members that
        are added in the future will be <em>individually
        feature-detectable</em>, to allow for backwards-compatibility with
        older implementations that don't recognize those members. These new
        members might also be added as optional "MAY" requirements.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        There is <a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107">an open
        discussion</a> about how to provide feature-detection for dictionary
        members. Web Share will use the mechanism produced by that discussion.
      </div>
      <p data-link-for="Navigator">
        The <a>share()</a> method throws a <a>TypeError</a> if none of the
        specified members are present. The intention is that when a new member
        is added, it will also be added to this list of recognized members (so
        as to not throw an error). This is for future-proofing implementations:
        if a web site written against a future version of this spec uses
        <em>only</em> new members (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>navigator.share({image:
        x})</code>), it will be valid in future user agents, but a
        <a>TypeError</a> on user agents implementing an older version of the
        spec. Developers will be asked to feature-detect any new fields they
        rely on, to avoid having errors surface in their program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Editors of this spec will want to carefully consider the genericity of
        any new members being added, avoiding fields that are closely
        associated with a particular service, user agent or operating system,
        in favour of fields that can potentially be applied to a wide range of
        platforms and targets.
