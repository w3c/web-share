# Web Share API Interface

**Date**: 2017-05-02

The interface for Web Share is now described at
[https://wicg.github.io/web-share/](https://wicg.github.io/web-share/).

The basic Share API only allows share requests to be sent (this API does not
provide the capability to receive share requests). For a follow-up plan to have
websites receive share requests from the system, or other websites, see the
[Share Target API](https://github.com/mgiuca/web-share-target).

Examples of using the Share API for sharing can be seen in the
[explainer document](explainer.md).

**Note**: The Web Share API is the first concrete proposal of the [Ballista
project](https://github.com/chromium/ballista), which aims to explore
website-to-website and website-to-native interoperability.
