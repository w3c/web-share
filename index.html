        This specification defines an API for sharing text, links and other
        content to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The available share targets are not specified here; they are provided
        by the user agent. They could, for example, be apps, websites or
        contacts.

        This "Level 1" specification is relatively stable, with multiple

        Usage Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        This example shows a basic share operation. In response to a button
        click, this JavaScript code shares the current page's URL.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Basic usage">
        shareButton.addEventListener("click", async () =&gt; {
          try {
            await navigator.share({ title: "Example Page", url: "" });
            console.log("Data was shared successfully");
          } catch (err) {
            console.error("Share failed:", err.message);
          }
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        Note that a {{ShareData/url}} of `''` refers to the current page URL,
        just as it would in a link. Any other absolute or relative URL can also
        be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to this call to {{Navigator/share()}}, the user agent would
        display a picker or chooser dialog, allowing the user to select a
        target to share this title and the page URL to.

        Share targets
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>share target</dfn> is the abstract concept of a destination that
        the user agent will transmit the share data to. What constitutes a
        share target is at the discretion of the user agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A share target might not be directly able to accept a {{ShareData}}
        (due to not having been written with this API in mind). However, it
        MUST have the ability to receive data that matches some or all of the
        concepts exposed in {{ShareData}}. To <dfn>convert data to a format
        suitable for ingestion into the target</dfn>, the user agent SHOULD map
        the members of {{ShareData}} onto equivalent concepts in the target. It
        MAY discard members if necessary. The meaning of each member of the
        payload is at the discretion of the share target.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each share target MAY be made conditionally available depending on the
        {{ShareData}} payload delivered to the {{Navigator/share()}} method.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Once a share target has been given the payload, the share is considered
        successful. If the target considers the data unacceptable or an error
        occurs, it can either recover gracefully, or show an error message to
        the end-user; it cannot rely on the sender to handle errors. In other
        words, the {{Navigator/share()}} method is "fire and forget"; it does
        not wait for the target to approve or reject the payload.
      </div>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Examples of share targets
        </h3>
        <p>
          The list of share targets can be populated from a variety of sources,
          depending on the user agent and host operating system. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built-in service (e.g., "copy to clipboard").
          </li>
          <li>Native applications written for the host operating system.
          </li>
          <li>Contacts (e.g., the user agent directly shares to a person from
          the user's address book, using a specific app).
          </li>
          <li>Websites (e.g., the user agent fills in a template URL with the
          members of the {{ShareData}}, then navigates to that URL in a new
          browsing context).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          There is an attempt to standardize the registration of websites to
          receive share data for that final use case; see <a href=
          "https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target">Web Share Target</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          In some cases, the host operating system will provide a sharing or
          intent system similar to Web Share. In these cases, the user agent
          can simply forward the share data to the operating system and not
          talk directly to native applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mapping the {{ShareData}} to the share target (or operating system)'s
          native format can be tricky as some platforms will not have an
          equivalent set of members. For example, if the target has a "text"
          member but not a "URL" member, one solution is to concatenate both
          the {{ShareData/text}} and {{ShareData/url}} members of {{ShareData}}
          and pass the result in the "text" member of the target.

        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Web Share enables data to be sent from websites to native applications.
        While this ability is not unique to Web Share, it does come with a
        number of potential security issues that can vary in severity
        (depending on the underlying platform).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a requirement to not allow the website to learn which apps
        are installed, or which app was chosen from {{Navigator/share()}},
        because this information could be used for fingerprinting, as well as
        leaking details about the user's device.
        </li>
        <li>Implementors will want to carefully consider what information is
        revealed in the error message when {{Navigator/share()}} is rejected.
        Even distinguishing between the case where no targets are available and
        user cancellation could reveal information about which apps are
        installed on the user's device.
        </li>
        <li>There is a requirement that {{Navigator/share()}} presents the user
        with a dialog asking them to select a target application (even if there
        is only one possible target). This surface serves as a security
        confirmation, ensuring that websites cannot silently send data to
        native applications.
        </li>
        <li>Due to the capabilities of the API surface, {{Navigator/share()}}
        is <a>available only in secure contexts</a> (such as `https://`
        schemes).
        </li>
        <li>Use of {{Navigator/share()}} from a <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode">private browsing mode</a>
        might leak private data to a third-party application that does not
        respect the user's privacy setting. User agents could present
        additional warnings or disable the feature entirely when in a private
        browsing mode, but this is not mandated as the chooser UI could be
        considered sufficient warning.
        </li>
        <li>The data passed to {{Navigator/share()}} might be used to exploit
        buffer overflow or other remote code execution vulnerabilities in
        native applications that receive shares. There is no general way to
        guard against this, but implementors will want to be aware that it is a
        possibility.

        Extensibility of this API

        The Web Share API is designed to be extended in the future by way of
        new members added to the {{ShareData}} dictionary, to allow both
        sharing of new types of data (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/web-share/issues/12">images</a>) and strings
        with new semantics (<i>e.g.</i> author).

      <div class="warning">
        This doesn't mean user agents can add whatever members they like. It

        The three members {{ShareData/title}}, {{ShareData/text}}, and
        {{ShareData/url}}, are part of the base feature set, and
        implementations that provide {{Navigator/share()}} need to accept all
        three. Any new members that are added in the future will be
        <em>individually feature-detectable</em>, to allow for
        backwards-compatibility with older implementations that don't recognize
        those members. These new members might also be added as optional "MAY"
        requirements.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        There is <a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107">an open
        discussion</a> about how to provide feature-detection for dictionary
        members. Web Share will use the mechanism produced by that discussion.
      </div>
      <p>
        The {{Navigator/share()}} method returns a rejected promise with a
        {{TypeError}} if none of the specified members are present. The
        intention is that when a new member is added, it will also be added to
        this list of recognized members. This is for future-proofing
        implementations: if a web site written against a future version of this
        spec uses <em>only</em> new members (<i>e.g.</i>,
        `navigator.share({image: x})`), it will be valid in future user agents,
        but a {{TypeError}} on user agents implementing an older version of the
        spec. Developers will be asked to feature-detect any new members they
        rely on, to avoid having errors surface in their program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Editors of this spec will want to carefully consider the genericity of
        any new members being added, avoiding members that are closely
        associated with a particular service, user agent or operating system,
        in favour of members that can potentially be applied to a wide range of
        platforms and targets.
