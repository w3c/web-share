        Usage Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        This example shows a basic share operation. In response to a button
        click, this JavaScript code shares the current page's URL.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Basic usage">
        shareButton.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
          navigator.share({title: 'Example Page', url: ''})
              .then(console.log('Share successful'));
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        Note that a <a for="ShareData"><code>url</code></a> of <code>''</code>
        refers to the current page URL, just as it would in a link. Any other
        absolute or relative URL can also be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to this call to <a><code>navigator.share</code></a>, the
        user agent would display a picker or chooser dialog, allowing the user
        to select a target to share this title and the page URL to.

        Share targets
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn data-lt="share targets">share target</dfn> is the abstract
        concept of a destination that the user agent will transmit the share
        data to. What constitutes a share target is at the discretion of the
        user agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A share target might not be directly able to accept a <a>ShareData</a>
        (due to not having been written with this API in mind). However, it
        MUST have the ability to receive data that matches some or all of the
        concepts exposed in <a>ShareData</a>. To <dfn>convert data to a format
        suitable for ingestion into the target</dfn>, the user agent SHOULD map
        the fields of <a>ShareData</a> onto equivalent concepts in the target.
        It MAY discard fields if necessary. The meaning of each field of the
        payload is at the discretion of the share target.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each share target MAY be made conditionally available depending on the
        <a>ShareData</a> payload delivered to the <a for="Navigator">share</a>
        method.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Once a share target has been given the payload, the share is considered
        successful. If the target considers the data unacceptable or an error
        occurs, it can either recover gracefully, or show an error message to
        the end-user; it cannot rely on the sender to handle errors. In other
        words, the <a for="Navigator">share</a> method is "fire and forget"; it
        does not wait for the target to approve or reject the payload.
      </div>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Examples of share targets
        </h3>
        <p>
          The list of share targets can be populated from a variety of sources,
          depending on the user agent and host operating system. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built-in service (e.g., "copy to clipboard").
          </li>
          <li>Native applications written for the host operating system.
          </li>
          <li>Contacts (e.g., the user agent directly shares to a person from
          the user's address book, using a specific app).
          </li>
          <li>Websites (e.g., the user agent fills in a template URL with the
          fields of the <a>ShareData</a>, then navigates to that URL in a new
          browsing context).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          There is an attempt to standardize the registration of websites to
          receive share data for that final use case; see <a href=
          "https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target">Web Share Target</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          In some cases, the host operating system will provide a sharing or
          intent system similar to Web Share. In these cases, the user agent
          can simply forward the share data to the operating system and not
          talk directly to native applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mapping the <a>ShareData</a> to the share target (or operating
          system)'s native format can be tricky as some platforms will not have
          an equivalent set of fields. For example, if the target has a "text"
          field but not a "URL" field, one solution is to concatenate both the
          <a for="ShareData">text</a> and <a for="ShareData">url</a> fields of
          <a>ShareData</a> and pass the result in the "text" field of the
          target.

        Web Share enables data to be sent from websites to native applications.
        While this ability is not unique to Web Share, it does come with a
        number of potential security issues that can vary in severity
        (depending on the underlying platform).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a requirement to not allow the website to learn which apps
        are installed, or which app was chosen from
        <a><code>navigator.share</code></a>, because this information could be
        used for fingerprinting, as well as leaking details about the user's
        device.
        </li>
        <li>Implementors will want to carefully consider what information is
        revealed in the error message when <a><code>navigator.share</code></a>
        is rejected. Even distinguishing between the case where no targets are
        available and user cancellation could reveal information about which
        apps are installed on the user's device.
        </li>
        <li>There is a requirement that <a><code>navigator.share</code></a>
        presents the user with a dialog asking them to select a target
        application (even if there is only one possible target). This surface
        serves as a security confirmation, ensuring that websites cannot
        silently send data to native applications.
        </li>
        <li>Due to the capabilities of the API surface,
        <a><code>navigator.share</code></a> is <a data-cite=
        "WEBIDL#dfn-available-only-in-secure-contexts">available only in secure
        contexts</a> (such as <code>https://</code> schemes).
        </li>
        <li>Use of <a><code>navigator.share</code></a> from a <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode">private browsing mode</a>
        might leak private data to a third-party application that does not
        respect the user's privacy setting. User agents could present
        additional warnings or disable the feature entirely when in a private
        browsing mode, but this is not mandated as the chooser UI could be
        considered sufficient warning.
        </li>
        <li>The data passed to <a><code>navigator.share</code></a> might be
        used to exploit buffer overflow or other remote code execution
        vulnerabilities in native applications that receive shares. There is no

        with new semantics (<i>e.g.</i> author).
      </p>
      <div class="warning">
        This doesn't mean user agents can add whatever members they like. It
        means that new members can be added to the standard in the future.
      </div>
      <p>
        The three members <a for="ShareData">title</a>, <a for=
        "ShareData">text</a>, and <a for="ShareData">url</a>, are part of the
        base feature set, and implementations that provide
        <a><code>navigator.share</code></a> need to accept all three. Any new
        members that are added in the future will be <em>individually
        feature-detectable</em>, to allow for backwards-compatibility with
        older implementations that don't recognise those members. These new
        members might also be added as optional "MAY" requirements.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        There is <a href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107">an open
        discussion</a> about how to provide feature-detection for dictionary
        members. Web Share will use the mechanism produced by that discussion.
      </div>
      <p>
        The <a for="Navigator"><code>share</code></a> method throws a
        <a data-cite=
        "!WEBIDL#exceptiondef-typeerror"><code>TypeError</code></a> if none of
        the specified members are present. The intention is that when a new
        member is added, it will also be added to this list of recognised
        members (so as to not throw an error). This is for future-proofing
        implementations: if a web site written against a future version of this
        spec uses <em>only</em> new members (<i>e.g.</i>,
        <code>navigator.share({image: x})</code>), it will be valid in future
        user agents, but a <a data-cite=
        "!WEBIDL#exceptiondef-typeerror"><code>TypeError</code></a> on user
        agents implementing an older version of the spec. Developers will be
        asked to feature-detect any new fields they rely on, to avoid having
        errors surface in their program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Editors of this spec will want to carefully consider the genericity of
        any new members being added, avoiding fields that are closely
        associated with a particular service, user agent or operating system,
        in favour of fields that can potentially be applied to a wide range of
        platforms and targets.
