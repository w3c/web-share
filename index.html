        The available share targets are not specified here; they are provided

      <h2>
        Usage Examples
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Sharing text and links
      </h3>
      <p>
        This example shows a basic share operation. In response to a button
        click, this JavaScript code shares the current page's URL.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Sharing text and URL">
        shareButton.addEventListener("click", async () =&gt; {
          try {
            await navigator.share({ title: "Example Page", url: "" });
            console.log("Data was shared successfully");
          } catch (err) {
            console.error("Share failed:", err.message);
          }
        });
      </pre>
      <p>
        Note that a {{ShareData/url}} of `''` refers to the current page URL,
        just as it would in a link. Any other absolute or relative URL can also
        be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to this call to {{Navigator/share()}}, the user agent would
        display a picker or chooser dialog, allowing the user to select a
        target to share this title and the page URL to.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Sharing a file
      </h3>
      <p>
        This example shows how to share a file. Note that the
        {{ShareData/files}} member is an array, allowing for multiple files to
        be shared.
      </p>
      <pre class="example javascript" title="Sharing a file">
        shareButton.addEventListener("click", async () =&gt; {
          const file = new File(data, "some.png", { type: "image/png" });
          try {
            await navigator.share({
              title: "Example File",
              files: [file]
            });
          } catch (err) {
            console.error("Share failed:", err.message);
          }
        });
      </pre>
      <h3>
        Validating a share
      </h3>
      <p>
        Calling {{Navigator/canShare()}} method with a {{ShareData}} dictionary
        [=validate share data|validates=] the shared data. Unlike
        {{Navigator/share()}}, it can be called without [=transient
        activation=].
      </p>
      <pre class="js example">
        const file = new File([], "some.png", { type: "image/png" });

        // Check if files are supported
        if (navigates.canShare({files: [file]})) {
          // Sharing a png file would probably be ok...
        }

        // Check if a URL is ok to share...
        if (navigates.canShare({ url: someURL })) {
          // The URL is valid and can probably be shared...
        }
      </pre>
      <h3>
        Checking if members are supported
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because of how WebIDL dictionaries work, members passed to
        {{Navigator/share(())}} that are unknown to the user agent are ignored.
        This can be a problem when sharing multiple members, but the user agent
        doesn't support sharing one of those members. To be sure that every
        member being passed is supported by the user agent, you can pass them
        to {{Navigator/canShare()}} individually to check if they are
        supported.
      </p>
      <pre class="js example" title="Future-proofing shares">
        const data = {
          title: "Example Page",
          url: "https://example.com",
          text: "This is a text to share",
          someFutureThing: "some future thing",
        };
        const allSupported = Object.entries(data).every(([key, value]) =&gt; {
          return navigator.canShare({ [key]: value });
        });
        if (allSupported) {
          await navigator.share(data);
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can adjust application's UI to not show UI
        components for unsupported members.
      </p>
      <pre class="js example" title="Filtering out unsupported members">
        const data = {
          title: "Example Page",
          url: "https://example.com",
          text: "This is a text to share",
          someFutureThing: "some future thing",
        };
        
        // Things that are not supported...
        const unsupported = Object.entries(data).filter(([key, value]) =&gt; {
          return !navigator.canShare({ [key]: value });
        });

            <dfn>share()</dfn> method
          </h4>
          <p>
            When the {{Navigator/share()}} method is called with argument
            |data:ShareData|, run the listed steps listed below while taking
            into consideration the following security implications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web Share enables data to be sent from websites to a [=share
            target=], which can be a native applications. While this ability is
            not unique to Web Share, it does come with a number of potential
            security risks that can vary in severity (depending on the
            underlying platform).
          </p>
          <p>
            The data passed to {{Navigator/share()}} might be used to exploit
            buffer overflow or other remote code execution vulnerabilities in
            the [=share target=] that receive shares. There is no general way
            to guard against this, but implementors will want to be aware that
            it is a possibility (particularly when sharing files).
          </p>
          <p>
            [=Share targets=] that dereference a shared URL and forward that
            information on might inadvertently forward information that might
            be otherwise confidential. This can lead to unexpected information
            leakage if shares reference content that is only accessible by that
            application, the host on which it runs, or its network location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Malicious sites might exploit share targets that leak information
            by providing URLs that ultimately resolve to local resources,
            including, but not limited to, "file:" URLs or local services that
            might otherwise be inaccessible. Even though this API limits shared
            URLS to a restricted set of [=sharable schemes=], use of redirects
            to other URLs or tweaks to DNS records for hosts in those URLs
            might be used to cause applications to acquire content.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid being used in these attacks, share targets can consume the
            URL, retrieve the content, and process that information without
            sharing it. For instance, a photo editing application might
            retrieve an image that is "shared" with it. A share target can also
            share the URL without fetching any of the referenced content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Share targets that fetch content for the purposes of offering a
            preview or for sharing content risk information leakage. Content
            that is previewed and authorized by a user might be safe to
            forward, however it is not always possible for a person to identify
            when information should be confidential, so forwarding any content
            presents a risk. In particular, the {{ShareData/title}} might be
            used by an attacker to trick a user into misinterpreting the nature
            of the content. <!--
              , as demonstrated in the [[Wylecial]] <a data-cite=
              "Wylecial#">proof of concept attack</a>
            -->
          </p>
          <p>
            As with any user of {{DOMException}}, implementors need to
            carefully consider what information is revealed in the error
            message when {{Navigator/share()}} is rejected. Even distinguishing
            between the case where no [=share targets=] are available and user
            cancellation could reveal information about which share targets are
            installed on the user's device.

      <h2>
        Share targets
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn data-export="">share target</dfn> is the abstract concept of a
        destination that the user agent will transmit the share data to. What
        constitutes a share target is at the discretion of the user agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A share target might not be directly able to accept a {{ShareData}}
        (due to not having been written with this API in mind). However, it
        MUST have the ability to receive data that matches some or all of the
        concepts exposed in {{ShareData}}. To <dfn>convert data to a format
        suitable for ingestion into the target</dfn>, the user agent SHOULD map
        the members of {{ShareData}} onto equivalent concepts in the target. It
        MAY discard or combine members if necessary. The meaning of each member
        of the payload is at the discretion of the share target.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Mapping the {{ShareData}} to the share target's (or operating system's)
        native format can be tricky as some platforms will not have an
        equivalent set of members. For example, if the target has a "text"
        member but not a "URL" member (as is the case on Android), one solution
        is to concatenate both the {{ShareData/text}} and {{ShareData/url}}
        members of {{ShareData}} and pass the result in the "text" member of
        the target.
      </div>
      <p>
        Each share target MAY be made conditionally available depending on the
        {{ShareData}} payload delivered to the {{Navigator/share()}} method.
      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Examples of share targets
        </h3>
        <p>
          The list of share targets can be populated from a variety of sources,
          depending on the user agent and host operating system. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built-in service (e.g., "copy to clipboard").
          </li>
          <li>Native applications written for the host operating system.
          </li>
          <li>Contacts (e.g., the user agent directly shares to a person from
          the user's address book, using a specific app).
          </li>
          <li>Websites (e.g., the user agent fills in a template URL with the
          members of the {{ShareData}}, then navigates to that URL in a new
          browsing context).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          There is an attempt to standardize the registration of websites to
          receive share data for that final use case; see <a href=
          "https://github.com/w3c/web-share-target">Web Share Target</a>.
        </div>
        <p>
          In some cases, the host operating system will provide a sharing or
          intent system similar to Web Share. In these cases, the user agent
          can simply forward the share data to the operating system and not
          talk directly to native applications.

      <ul>
        <li>By design, the API cannot be used by a website to learn which
        [=share targets=] are available, or which share target the user chose
        from {{Navigator/share()}}. This is to prevent leaking information that
        could be used for fingerprinting, as well as leaking details about the
        user's device or user's preferred share targets.
        </li>
        <li>Use of {{Navigator/share()}} from a <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_mode">private browsing mode</a>
        might leak private data to a third-party application that does not
        respect the user's privacy setting. User agents could present
        additional warnings or MAY disable the feature entirely when in a
        private browsing mode, but this is not mandated as the chooser UI could
        be considered sufficient warning.
